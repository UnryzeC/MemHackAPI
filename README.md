# MemHackAPI
Jass-language based API to enhance Warcraft 3

What is MemHack?
  - TBD

What do I need to compile it?
  - https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/w3x2lni-v2-7-2.305201/

What World Editor do you suggest for it?
  - https://xgm.guru/p/wc3/jassnewgenpack-r

Which version of Warcraft 3 do you suggest?
  - 1.26a

Does it work on Reforged?
  - No

Will it ever work on Reforged?
  - Most likely no, unless someone is kind enough to help me disassemble it, so I can find the needed offsets. And if the memory "exploit" still works.

What's the point of MemHack?
  - It allows any developer to add new functions that do not exist in older versions of Warcraft 3, like the Effect API that I added, or changing unit's model in-game, and so on.
